# Scratch Notes - Analysis Research

Working notes for food security survey analysis project. FLOAT zone - no formatting rules.

## Current Work

Project moved from inbox to workbench. Agent-foreman harness in place.

## Quick Notes

- Survey has versions A (no food waste) and B (with food waste)
- Need to map Vietnam foods to HDDS food groups
- Income/expenditure needs Vietnam currency context
- Geocoded data available for spatial analysis
- 10 research areas to work through (Area 0-9)

## Reminders

- Read ai/feature_list.json before starting work
- Use agent-foreman commands (status, next, check, done)
- Document Vietnam monetary context thoroughly
- Handle skip logic carefully (structural vs. non-response missing)

## Ideas

- Consider creating visualization of research area dependencies
- May need literature review on Vietnam HDDS adaptations
- Spatial maps could show regional variation in food security
