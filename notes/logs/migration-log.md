# Migration Log - Analysis Research

**Date:** 2025-12-10

**Destination:** /Users/emersonburke/Desktop/workbench/projects/analysis-rsrch

## Migration Summary

Moved from inbox (FLOAT zone) to workbench (WORKBENCH zone) with proper structure.

## Structure Created

- CONTEXT.md - Project overview, goals, current status
- SPECIFICATION.md - Requirements, acceptance criteria, technical specs
- scratch.md - Working notes (FLOAT within project)
- notes/ - Research and decision documentation
  - notes/decisions/ - Architecture decision records
  - notes/research/ - Research findings
  - notes/logs/ - Progress logs and session notes
- output/ - Analysis outputs (follows LIBRARY rules)

## Content Migrated

All original files preserved:
- ai/ - Agent-foreman harness (feature_list.json, progress.log, init.sh)
- research-areas/ - 10 research areas (Area 0-9) with templates and scripts
- plans/ - Feature planning documents
- readme.txt - Original project notes
- r-survey-food-security-research-analysis.md - Detailed analysis notes
- CLAUDE.md - Agent-foreman instructions

## Project Status

- Phase: Active
- Type: Thesis research - food security survey analysis
- Framework: Agent-foreman for feature-driven development
- TDD Mode: Configured for structured analysis development

## Key Characteristics

- R-based statistical analysis
- Vietnamese household survey data
- Multiple measurement instruments (HDDS, FIES, income/expenditure)
- Geocoded household locations for spatial analysis
- 10 comprehensive research areas covering all analysis aspects

## Next Actions

1. Review ai/feature_list.json for current feature backlog
2. Read ai/progress.log for development history
3. Use agent-foreman commands (status, next, check, done)
4. Work through research areas systematically (Area 0-9)
5. Document Vietnam monetary context thoroughly
6. Handle survey versions A/B appropriately

## Zone Transition

From: FLOAT (no rules, quick capture)
To: WORKBENCH (moderate structure, CONTEXT.md + SPECIFICATION.md required)

Project now has proper documentation and structure for systematic development while maintaining working notes in scratch.md (FLOAT within project).
