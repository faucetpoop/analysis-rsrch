# Construct-Question Mapping Table

**Reference:** [00-RESEARCH-AIM.md](../00-RESEARCH-AIM.md) for framework definitions.

## Instructions
Map each analytic construct to the survey questions that measure it.
This table serves as documentation for your methods section.

## Turner Framework Coverage Checklist

Before completing the mapping, verify coverage of all Turner domains:

### External Determinants
- [ ] Vendor properties (who sells, where, when)
- [ ] Product properties (what's available, quality, diversity)
- [ ] Market properties (structure, density, distance)
- [ ] Marketing/regulation (policy environment)

### Personal Determinants
- [ ] Accessibility (physical/geographic access)
- [ ] Affordability (economic access)
- [ ] Convenience (time/effort)
- [ ] Desirability (preferences, norms)

### Outcome
- [ ] HDDS (dietary diversity)

### Context/Controls
- [ ] Demographics
- [ ] Household characteristics
