## Research Aim Reminder

> Examine how **external and personal food-environment determinants** are associated with **household dietary diversity** in Long Biên District, Hà Nội, Vietnam.

**Framework:** Turner et al. (2018) as primary lens
**Scope:** Descriptive mapping study (NOT causal testing)

## Scope Constraints: What You ARE and ARE NOT Doing

### This Thesis IS:

| Claim Type | Example | Allowed |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Descriptive characterization | "Long Biên's food environment is characterized by..." | Yes |
| Association | "Higher income is associated with higher HDDS" | Yes |
| Pattern identification | "Households using wet markets showed different patterns than..." | Yes |
| Framework application | "Applying Turner's framework reveals..." | Yes |
| Correlation | "External determinants correlate with dietary diversity" | Yes |

### This Thesis IS NOT:

| Claim Type | Example | Allowed |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Causal claim | "Urbanization causes dietary change" | No |
| Intervention effect | "Improving market access would increase HDDS" | No |
| Temporal claim | "HDDS has increased over time" | No |
| Policy evaluation | "Governance affects food security" | No |
| CCE validation | "The CCE framework explains..." | No (speculative only) |

## Framework-Specific Guardrails

### Turner et al. (2018) Alignment

**When discussing External determinants:**
- [ ] Describe what IS available, not what SHOULD be
- [ ] Characterize vendor/product/market properties, not their effects
- [ ] Report associations with HDDS, not causal impacts

**When discussing Personal determinants:**
- [ ] Describe how households interact with food environment
- [ ] Report associations between accessibility/affordability/convenience/desirability and HDDS
- [ ] Do not claim these determinants "cause" dietary outcomes

**When discussing HDDS (outcome):**
- [ ] Report as dietary diversity measure, not health outcome
- [ ] Describe distribution and patterns
- [ ] Associate with determinants, not attribute to causes

### Downs et al. Typology Alignment

**When using food environment typology:**
- [ ] Describe prevalence of environment types in Long Biên
- [ ] Characterize food sourcing patterns
- [ ] Do not claim typology determines diet

### CCE Framework (Discussion Only)

**When introducing CCE speculatively:**
- [ ] Explicitly label as "speculative" or "for future research"
- [ ] Do not present as empirically validated
- [ ] Frame as hypothesis-generating, not conclusion

## What This Survey CAN Tell You

These are valid conclusions from your data:

### Descriptive
- [ ] Distribution of HDDS in Long Biên households
- [ ] Prevalence of different food sourcing patterns
- [ ] Characteristics of households by food security status
- [ ] Coverage of Turner framework domains by your survey

### Associational
- [ ] Associations between External determinants and HDDS
- [ ] Associations between Personal determinants and HDDS
- [ ] Variation in HDDS across demographic groups
- [ ] Correlations among food environment factors

### Framework Application
- [ ] How Turner's framework maps to Long Biên
- [ ] Which Downs typology categories dominate
- [ ] Gaps in framework coverage

## What This Survey CANNOT Tell You

### Causality Limitations (Cross-sectional)

| Cannot Claim | Why | Instead Say |
|--------------|-----|-------------|
| X causes higher HDDS | No temporal ordering | "X is associated with higher HDDS" |
| Urbanization affects diet | No before/after comparison | "Urban areas show patterns of..." |
| Improving X would improve Y | No intervention | "X and Y are positively correlated" |

### Out-of-Scope Inferences

| Cannot Claim | Why | Framework Issue |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| Migration effects | Not measured/tested | Outside scope |
| Governance effects | Not measured/tested | Outside scope |
| Policy effectiveness | Would require causal design | Outside scope |
| CCE validation | Speculative only | Discussion only |

### Measurement Limitations

| Cannot Claim | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| Actual health outcomes | HDDS is proxy for diet quality |
| Micronutrient status | Would need biochemical data |
| Food quantities | HDDS is binary (consumed/not) |
| Household food security trajectory | Cross-sectional snapshot |

---

## Language Discipline

### Words to AVOID vs USE

| AVOID | USE INSTEAD |
|-------|-------------|
| causes | is associated with |
| determines | relates to |
| impact of X on Y | association between X and Y |
| leads to | co-occurs with |
| proves | suggests / indicates |
| significantly improves | positively associated with |
| urbanization leads to | urban areas show |
| migration affects | migrants show patterns of |

### Sentence Patterns

**Causal (AVOID):**
> "Higher income improves dietary diversity because households can afford..."

**Associational (USE):**
> "Higher income is associated with higher dietary diversity. Households with greater income showed..."

**Interventionist (AVOID):**
> "Improving market access would increase HDDS in Long Biên."

**Descriptive (USE):**
> "Households with closer market access showed higher HDDS, suggesting a positive association between accessibility and dietary diversity."

## Biases to Watch For

| Bias Type | Affected Variables | Turner Domain | How to Handle |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Social desirability | Income, food waste | Personal: Affordability | Acknowledge in limitations |
| Recall bias | HDDS (24hr), food frequency | Outcome | Note recall period |
| Selection bias | Who was surveyed | All | Describe sample |
| Respondent knowledge | Prices, quantities | External: Product | Document who answered |

## Over-interpretation Risks by Section

### Results Section
- [ ] Report associations, not effects
- [ ] Use confidence intervals, not certainty
- [ ] Present descriptive statistics before associations

### Discussion Section
- [ ] Interpret through Turner framework
- [ ] Compare to literature (associations, not causes)
- [ ] Introduce CCE as speculative only
- [ ] Acknowledge framework gaps

### Conclusion Section
- [ ] Summarize patterns found (descriptive)
- [ ] Suggest future research (causal designs)
- [ ] Do not make policy recommendations based on associations alone

## Self-Check Questions

Before writing any claim, ask:

1. **Is this descriptive or causal?**
   - Descriptive: Proceed
   - Causal: Reframe as association

2. **Does this match my scope?**
   - Descriptive mapping: Proceed
   - Causal testing: Out of scope

3. **Am I applying Turner framework correctly?**
   - External/Personal → HDDS association: Correct
   - X causes HDDS: Incorrect

4. **Would my committee accept this language?**
   - "Associated with": Yes
   - "Causes/determines": No

5. **Am I going beyond cross-sectional data?**
   - Single time point description: OK
   - Change over time: Not supported

---

## Limitations Section Starter

Use these points in your limitations:

1. **Cross-sectional design:** Cannot establish causality or temporal relationships between food environment determinants and dietary diversity.

2. **Descriptive scope:** This study characterizes associations; future research with experimental or longitudinal designs is needed to test causal hypotheses.

3. **Framework coverage:** Turner et al. (2018) framework is applied as-is; some domains may be incompletely captured by available survey questions.

4. **Single district:** Findings describe Long Biên and may not generalize to other Vietnamese urban contexts.

5. **CCE speculation:** The Community/Collective Environment framework is introduced speculatively and requires empirical validation.
