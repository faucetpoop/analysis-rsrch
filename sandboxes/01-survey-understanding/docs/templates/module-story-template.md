## Framework Alignment

**Primary Turner domain:**
- [ ] External: Vendor properties
- [ ] External: Product properties
- [ ] External: Market properties
- [ ] External: Marketing/regulation
- [ ] Personal: Accessibility
- [ ] Personal: Affordability
- [ ] Personal: Convenience
- [ ] Personal: Desirability
- [ ] Outcome: Dietary diversity (HDDS)
- [ ] Context: Control variables
- [ ] Mixed: Multiple domains (list below)

**HLPE pathway position:**
- [ ] Food supply chain
- [ ] Food environment
- [ ] Consumer behavior
- [ ] Diet/nutrition outcome

**Downs et al. environment type (if applicable):**
- [ ] Wild
- [ ] Cultivated
- [ ] Informal
- [ ] Formal
- [ ] Modern
- [ ] N/A

**In scope for descriptive mapping?**
- [ ] Yes - directly measures Turner framework component
- [ ] Yes - provides context/control variables
- [ ] Partial - some questions in scope, some not
- [ ] No - outside framework (document why included)

## Purpose Statement

> This module captures **[WHAT CONCEPT]** because **[WHY IT MATTERS FOR TURNER FRAMEWORK]**, and feeds into **[WHICH ANALYSIS: External determinants? Personal determinants? HDDS outcome?]**.

**Example (HDDS module):**
> This module captures **dietary diversity through 24-hour food group recall** because **HDDS is the primary outcome variable in Turner's framework**, and feeds into **the dependent variable in all association analyses**.

**Example (Income module):**
> This module captures **household income and expenditure** because **affordability is a key personal determinant in Turner's framework**, and feeds into **Personal determinants → HDDS association analysis**.

## Framework Role

### How This Module Fits Turner et al. (2018)

```
[Draw or describe where this module sits in the framework]

External ──┐
           ├──► HDDS
Personal ──┘

This module measures: [External / Personal / Outcome / Context]
```

### Specific Turner Sub-domains Covered

| Sub-domain | Questions | Coverage |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| | | Full / Partial / Proxy |

## Skip Logic

**This module is shown when:**
```
[relevant expression from XLSForm]
```

**Questions within this module have conditions:**

| Question | Shown When | Structural NA When | Framework Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| | | | [Does this affect External/Personal coverage?] |

---

## Key Assumptions

What does this module assume about respondents?

- [ ] They can accurately recall [time period]
- [ ] They understand the categories
- [ ] They are willing to report honestly about [topic]
- [ ] The household member answering knows about [topic]

**Framework-specific assumptions:**
- [ ] This adequately captures [Turner domain]
- [ ] The operationalization aligns with Turner's definition

---

## Potential Weaknesses

| Issue | Affected Questions | Turner Domain Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Recall bias | | Does this bias External or Personal measurement? | |
| Social desirability | | | |
| Proxy measurement | | Is this a direct or proxy measure of Turner concept? | |

## How This Feeds Analysis

**Used in script:** `scripts/0X-[script-name].R`

**Framework role in analysis:**
- [ ] Outcome variable (HDDS)
- [ ] External determinant predictor
- [ ] Personal determinant predictor
- [ ] Control variable
- [ ] Stratification variable

**Transformation:**
- [ ] Sum of items → score
- [ ] Mean of items → scale score
- [ ] Categorization → groups
- [ ] Direct use → no transformation

**Output indicator(s):**
- [ ] [Indicator name] (range: X-Y)
