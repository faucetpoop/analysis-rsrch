# Area 0 – Deep Understanding of Survey & Context

**Goal:** Really understand what your survey means (concepts, wording, and Vietnam context), not just how to crunch it.

---

## 0.1 Survey Intent & Conceptual Backbone

### What to dig into / reflect on

**Overall purpose of the survey:**
- What research questions was it designed to answer?
- Which modules serve which research questions?

**Concepts behind modules:**
- Food insecurity → which dimension(s)? (access, utilisation, stability, etc.)
- Dietary diversity → what exactly is being approximated (quality, micronutrient adequacy)?
- Food waste → households' behaviours, norms, constraints?
- Income/expenditure → welfare, vulnerability, poverty?

### Outputs for yourself

- A short written "story per module":
  - "This module captures X because Y, and later feeds into Z indicator(s)."

---

## 0.2 Question-level Reading: Content, Logic, and Assumptions

### What to review

**Go through the XLSForm question by question and ask:**
- What is this question trying to measure? (latent construct)
- What assumptions does it make about respondents' understanding?
- In which situations is this question misleading or weak?

**Pay special attention to:**
- Screeners and filters (who gets included/excluded downstream)
- Frequency / quantity questions (food consumption, spending)
- Recall period (does it suit the local reality & seasonality?)
- Likert items (what attitude or perception is really underneath)

### Outputs

- A small note (few words) next to each key question:
  - "concept: perceived food insecurity"
  - "risk: recall bias for occasional foods", etc.
- A list of known weaknesses (for the limitations section)

---

## 0.3 Contextual Understanding (Vietnam, Local Food & Money Realities)

### What to research / reflect on

**Food environment & diets:**
- Typical household diets in your study area
- Common staple foods, vegetables, proteins
- Seasonality: are you capturing a "normal" period or a special one?

**Food waste context:**
- Cultural attitudes towards food waste
- How leftovers, sharing, composting, feeding animals, etc. work locally
- Any local policies, campaigns, or norms relevant to food waste

**Economic context:**
- Typical income sources in your population (formal/informal, remittances, agriculture, etc.)
- Key expenditure categories (food, rent, education, fuel, etc.)
- How people talk about money (weekly vs monthly; cash vs in-kind)

### Outputs

- 1–2 pages of "context notes" you can later mine for:
  - Introduction (context)
  - Methods (why your questions make sense here)
  - Discussion (why some results look the way they do)

---

## 0.4 From Survey Questions to Analytic Constructs

### What to clarify

**For each key construct (HDD, food insecurity, food waste behaviour, vulnerability, etc.):**
- Which specific questions/items are used?
- Which questions are supporting context rather than direct components?
- Are there redundant questions you won't use? Why?

**Build a "construct map":**
- Rows = constructs (HDD, "perceived food security", "FW attitudes", "economic vulnerability"…)
- Columns = survey questions feeding into that construct
- Notes on transformation: sums, indices, categories, etc.

### Outputs

- A construct–question mapping table (can double as an appendix figure or internal documentation)
- Clear justification in your methods for why this question set measures that concept in this context

---

## 0.5 Interpretation Limits & Bias Awareness

### What to think through

**Who might have answered differently from what they do?**
- Social desirability (e.g. admitting to wasting food, or being food insecure)
- Gender dynamics (who in the household answered? main cook? head?)
- Literacy / numeracy issues (for frequency, quantities, money)

**What your survey cannot tell you:**
- Causality (cross-sectional limitations)
- Aspects of diet or waste you don't see (e.g. micronutrients, informal sharing)
- Households not covered by your sample (migrants, homeless, etc.)

### Outputs

- A bullet list of "Interpretation guardrails" you can keep in front of you while analysing and writing:
  - "Don't over-interpret small HDD differences as health outcomes."
  - "Food waste self-reports likely under-estimate true waste."
  - Etc.

## Vietnam-Specific Context Resources

### Poverty and Economic Benchmarks

**National Poverty Statistics (2023-2025):**
- 2023 National Poverty Line: 3.4% of population
- 2025 Target: ~1% multidimensional poverty rate
- Ethnic Minorities 2025: 12.55% poverty rate (target)

**World Bank Benchmarks:**
- Extreme Poverty ($2.15/day, 2017 PPP): <1% (2022)
- Lower-Middle Income ($3.65/day): 4.2%
- Upper-Middle Income ($6.85/day): 19.7%

**Interpretation:**
- Extreme poverty nearly eradicated
- 1 in 5 Vietnamese remain vulnerable to poverty shocks
- Rural, agriculture-based, ethnic minority households at higher risk

### Key Vietnam Food Security Research

**Recent Study (November 2024):**
- "Does escaping the multidimensional poverty line improve family food security? Evidence from rural Vietnam"
- Journal: Agriculture & Food Security (BioMed Central)
- Data: VARHS 2016 & 2018 (407 low-income households)
- Indicators: HDDS + per capita food expenditure

**Other Relevant Studies:**
- COVID-19 impact on income shock and food insecurity (PMC 2022)
- Urban food insecurity in Ho Chi Minh City (BMC Public Health 2015)
- Persistent rural poverty and ethnic minorities (Journal of Development Studies 2025)

### Available Vietnam Datasets

**VHLSS (Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey):**
- Implementing Agency: General Statistics Office (GSO)
- Frequency: Annual (2011-2022)
- Sample: ~47,000 households (2022)
- Access: Email hoptacquocte@gso.gov.vn

**VARHS (Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey):**
- Type: Panel survey of rural households
- Coverage: 12 provinces, ~2,600 households
- Focus: Rural land, credit, employment, food expenditures
- Access: Open via UNU-WIDER (https://www.wider.unu.edu/database/viet-nam-data)
