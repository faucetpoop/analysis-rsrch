## Quick Status

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1. Survey Intent | Not started | 0/? modules |
| 2. Question Analysis | Not started | 0/? questions |
| 3. Vietnam Context | Not started | |
| 4. Construct Mapping | Not started | |
| 5. Interpretation Limits | Not started | |

**Overall:** Not started

## Current Step

> **Next:** Open your XLSForm and start documenting module stories

---

## Phase 1: Survey Intent & Module Stories

For each survey module, create a story file in `outputs/module-stories/`.

| Module | File Created | Story Written |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Demographics | [ ] | [ ] |
| Food Consumption | [ ] | [ ] |
| Dietary Diversity | [ ] | [ ] |
| Food Security | [ ] | [ ] |
| Income | [ ] | [ ] |
| Expenditure | [ ] | [ ] |
| Food Waste | [ ] | [ ] |
| *Add your modules* | | |

**Done when:** Every module has a story explaining what/why/feeds-into.

---

## Phase 2: Question-Level Analysis

Track progress in `outputs/question-annotations.csv`.

- [ ] All questions reviewed
- [ ] Concepts documented
- [ ] Weaknesses noted
- [ ] Skip logic mapped

**Done when:** `question-annotations.csv` has an entry for every survey question.

---

## Phase 3: Vietnam Context Research

Complete `outputs/vietnam-context-notes.md`.

- [ ] Food environment section
- [ ] Seasonality documented
- [ ] Food waste context
- [ ] Economic context
- [ ] Poverty benchmarks
- [ ] Literature notes

**Done when:** 1-2 pages of context you can mine for Introduction/Methods/Discussion.

---

## Phase 4: Construct Mapping

Complete `outputs/construct-mapping.md`.

- [ ] All constructs listed
- [ ] Questions mapped to constructs
- [ ] Transformations documented
- [ ] Skip logic patterns noted
- [ ] Reverse coding identified

**Done when:** Table is complete and can serve as methods documentation.

---

## Phase 5: Interpretation Limits

Complete `outputs/interpretation-guardrails.md`.

- [ ] "Can tell you" list
- [ ] "Cannot tell you" list
- [ ] Biases documented
- [ ] Over-interpretation risks
- [ ] Population exclusions

**Done when:** You have a list to keep in front of you while analyzing.

## Completed Outputs

| Output | Location | Completed |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Module stories | `outputs/module-stories/*.md` | [ ] |
| Question annotations | `outputs/question-annotations.csv` | [ ] |
| Vietnam context | `outputs/vietnam-context-notes.md` | [ ] |
| Construct mapping | `outputs/construct-mapping.md` | [ ] |
| Interpretation guardrails | `outputs/interpretation-guardrails.md` | [ ] |

---

## Ready for Next Phase?

Before proceeding to `02-r-workflow`, verify:

- [ ] All module stories written
- [ ] Question annotations complete
- [ ] Vietnam context documented
- [ ] Construct map finished
- [ ] Guardrails list ready
- [ ] `survey-review-checklist.md` signed off

**Next:** [02-r-workflow](../02-r-workflow/) - Set up R environment
